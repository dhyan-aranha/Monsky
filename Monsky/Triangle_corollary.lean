/-!
I think that the most important subpart of this corollary is to show that the volume/area
of the triangles must add up to one. Measure theory tells us that the area of a disjoint union is
the sum of the areas. However, in order to apply this, we first need to that both that the `true' area
of a triangle corresponds to the version of area in Monsky's theorem. Secondly, we need that the
sets we work with are measurable.

To show that the true area is indeed the determinant area, we start by proving that the open hull of the
 `unit_triangle` has volume 1/2, where this triangle is given by
((0,0),(1,0)(0,1)). From this we calculate the volumes of the other triangles, using the fact that
the volume of an object is invariant under translation and scale with the determinant of a linear
transformation.

For the measurability we do something similar: we show that the unit triangle is measurable, then we
show that any nondegenerate triangle is a preimage of a measurable function of the open hull of
the unit triangle. For degenerate triangles, we use that they have measure zero, and are thus
null-measurable, which is a weaker statement but sufficient for our result (They are actually measurable
but this is probably quite annoying to show)
